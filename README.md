# Employee Details Management | SQL Project

1. Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the creation and management of an employee database using SQL. It focuses on storing employee details, enforcing data integrity through constraints, and performing common data manipulation and retrieval operations.

2. Purpose of the Project  
The purpose of this project is to showcase fundamental SQL concepts such as table creation, constraints, data insertion, updates, deletions, schema alterations, and analytical queries on employee data.

3. Database Design  
The database consists of a single table:
- Employees: Stores employee information including first name, last name, department, salary, joining date, age, and email  

The table is designed with:
- A primary key for unique employee identification  
- NOT NULL constraints for mandatory fields  
- CHECK constraints to validate salary and age values  

4. Data Insertion  
Employee records are inserted into the table with realistic values, representing different departments, salaries, joining dates, and age groups.

5. SQL Operations Performed  
The following SQL operations are demonstrated in this project:
- Retrieving specific columns from the table  
- Updating salaries for employees in a specific department  
- Deleting records based on age conditions  
- Adding new columns using ALTER TABLE  
- Renaming existing columns  
- Changing data types of columns  
- Filtering data using date conditions  
- Sorting records in descending order  
- Updating values across all rows  

6. Key Queries and Logic  
- Salary increment of 10% for IT department employees  
- Removal of employees older than a specified age  
- Retrieval of employees based on joining date  
- Sorting employees by salary in descending order  
- Incrementing age for all employees  

7. SQL Concepts Used  
- DDL statements (CREATE, DROP, ALTER)  
- DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT)  
- Constraints (PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, CHECK)  
- Filtering using WHERE clause  
- Sorting using ORDER BY  
- Data type conversion  

8. Tools Used  
- PostgreSQL (SQL)  

9. Use Case / Outcome  
This project demonstrates the ability to manage employee records using SQL while maintaining data integrity and performing real-world data operations. It is suitable for showcasing SQL fundamentals for Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and entry-level technical roles.
